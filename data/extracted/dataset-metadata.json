Exercising and being fit is becoming very important and almost a daily routine for all individuals and what better than to take a data-driven route for success to meet one's fitness goals.\n\n**Inspiration**\nIf you go to a gym, the first thing you realize is the myriad of exercises available to do. The exercises range from bodyweight, machine-based or dumbbell/barbell based. With so many exercises to do, beginners or even professional can wonder which the exercise that will target a specific muscle the best and that is where this analysis can be useful.
